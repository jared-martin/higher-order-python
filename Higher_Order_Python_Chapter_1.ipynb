The factorial of `n` is the number of different orders for a list of `n` different items. Mathematicians usually write it as a postfix (!) mark, so that the factorial of `n` is `n!`.

        "Now let’s back up a moment and look at what we did. We had a useful function, total_size(), which contained code for walking a directory structure that was going to be useful in other applications. So we made total_size() more general by pulling out all the parts that related to the computation of sizes, and replacing them with calls to arbitrary user-specified functions. The result was dir_walk(). Now, for any program that needs to walk a directory structure and do something, dir_walk() handles the walking part, and the argument functions handle the “do something” part. By passing the appropriate pair of functions to dir_walk(), we can make it do whatever we want it to. We’ve gained flexibility and the chance to re-use the dir_walk() code by factoring out the useful part and parametrizing it with two functional arguments. This is the heart of the functional style of programming\n",

        "The find_share function, however, has a problem: it takes much too long to run, especially if there is no solution. It has essentially the same problem as fib did: it repeats the same work over and over. For example, suppose it is trying to find a division of `1 2 3 4 5 6 7` with target sum 14. It might be investigating shares shares that contain 1 and 3, and then look to see if it can make `5 6 7` hit the target sum of 10. It can’t, so it will look for other solutions. Later on, it might investigate shares that contain 4, and again look to see if it can make `5 6 7` hit the target sum of 10. This is a waste of time; find_share should remember that `5 6 7` cannot hit a target sum of 10 from the first time it investigated that."
